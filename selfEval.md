# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- This really felt like an easy concept to grasp. There were a few challenges, but I stepped away when needed, or asked for help if I was struggling for to long. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- The second day my workflow went really well. Yesterday, I felt like I was so late with assignments that I tried to just get them done today. I wasn't sure what the level of challenge would be today. I could have taken more breaks.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- This exercise showed the real world applications that object literals can have.
